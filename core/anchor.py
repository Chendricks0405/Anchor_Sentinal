Anchor1 Core Engine (Protected)

This module represents the sealed core of the Anchor1 recursive perception engine.
The actual perceptual logic—including G′ computation, memory ripple integration,
and behavioral thresholding—is not included in this public version.

External interaction is handled through:
- bridge_input()
- get_anchor_state()
